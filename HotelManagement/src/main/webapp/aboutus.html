              <p> Surrounded by the fairy chimneys, underground
                cities and the majestic ruins of ancient civilizations, the Cappadocia
                Hotel is located in the neighbourhood of Esbelli overlooking Urgup.
                Having hosted many different civilizations for thousands of years,
                Urgup is one of the first settlement zones and most important towns of
                Cappadocia which is also known as the Land of Beautiful Horses. While
                its settlement history dates back to the Palaeolithic age, Cappadocia
                is known as the place where Christianity was first born. Having been
                one of the outstanding points of intersection of the Silk Road in the past,
                Cappadocia is now a place where nature communes with history. While having
                spectacular samples of interesting rock formations, known as 'fairy chimneys'
                formed by the rain and wind erosions of tuffs and lavas of Mount Erciyes, Mount
                 Hassan and Mount Gullu, Cappadocia is also the home of the greatest outdoor
                 museum of the world, namely Goreme Open-air Museum. Due to its natural and
                  cultural diversity, Cappadocia has been on the UNESCO World Natural & Cultural
                  Heritage List since 1985.
                   You can enjoy many activities such as hot-air balloon tours, trekking, bike-riding and horse-riding here.
                   Our entirely cave engraved and traditionally designed rooms with terraces have sizes ranging from 25 m2 to
                   40 m2, and each room attracts attention with its unique design The UBUNTU HOTEL was established by three South
                   African driven citizens who opened this hotel in hopes of bringing their culture and diversity into Turkey
                   to allow both countries to be one and have a breakthrough of having amazing vision that can meet in the middle
                   and become one. But not on for these two countries but the whole world.
                    BREAKFAST
                    The Cappadocia Hotel offers a Turkish Style breakfast buffet including a variety of pastries
                    and bread made with natural flour and custom baked, as well as natural jellies
                    from our kitchen and dairy products from villages in addition with cereals. Throughout the summer,
                    breakfast can also be enjoyed outdoors on the Terrace with its spectacular view. As well as incorporating
                    South African dishes and style.</p>
