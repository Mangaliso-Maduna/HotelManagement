# HotelManagement

the name of the of our project is Hotel management System, its a web application designed for users to be able to reserve a space in a hotel. also it help hotel managers/stuff to properly manage and maintain the hotel.
at first we intended to build the project using ASP.NET mvc and Microsoft SQL Server as indicated in the original proposal however based on the many issues we encounted during the design of our project, we ended up using SPRING Tool MVC for the implementation of this project.
for the real data part, indicated by "REVIEWS" in the web Application, we used reviews from one of the leading travel site as provided by customers. PLEASE NOTE THAT "This data set provides reviews of a single hotel".

The project consist of different models and containers, each having relevant information to the relevant page(HOME,GALLERY,REVIEWS,ABOUT).
